## 🚀 Overview
This project is my submission for the **Samanyastra Hackathon December 2025**.  
It is a fully responsive portfolio built using **React (JSX/JS)** and **Material UI**, strictly following all hackathon rules and guidelines.  

The portfolio dynamically loads all content from `data.js` without hardcoding any information.  
It adapts seamlessly across devices and screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience.
